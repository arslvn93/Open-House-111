    "bio": "You won‚Äôt catch me using words like ‚Äútop producer‚Äù or ‚Äú#1 agent‚Äù because real estate isn‚Äôt about bragging rights. It‚Äôs about people. Real people. Real stories. Real moves. Whether I‚Äôm negotiating a complex deal, putting a creative spin on marketing, or rallying the community for a local event, I bring clear communication, bold strategy, and a no-nonsense approach to getting things done. I lead clients through major life transitions with confidence, care, and a plan that works‚Äîbecause it matters. Not just to you, but to me too. If you want someone who knows the process inside and out, keeps things moving forward, and shows up ready to advocate fiercely on your behalf, I got you.",
